# UNIX Style Command Line Tools

## Abstract

This repo is meant to log my own personal abilities with various languages as well as my growth with the languages I learn. The various challenges I have based my code on acomplishing can be found at [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro).

The tools will be designed first and foremost to work on a UNIX system, but I will include a `README.md` file for every language specifying...
* what challenges have been complete,
* what functionalities compared to the tool being mimicked are / are not included,
* and dependencies for each language that are required to run the tools.

## Challenges that have been attempted

The following are the challenges that have been attempted, and in what languages I have completed them:

* [UNIX `wc` tool](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc/) - A simple tool to count lines, words, characters, bytes and the max line length seen within a file (or multiple files). \
